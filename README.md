- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mica-james
- This Project is called Spam vs Legitimate Email Detector
- The project's purpose was to take an existing database of spam and legitimate emails and seperate them.
- For the project, the user would need to download the SpamAssassin database of spam and legitimate emails.  
- The user would also need to have Thonny or any other IDE that can run Python code.
- A test that I ran was the code below... This seperates the emails with 0 being legitimate and 1 being spam.

- I also used 4 different classifiers to show accuracy, precision, and recall. The example below is the Confusion Matrix.
